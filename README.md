Newton Slots - simplea app page

## Getting Started

1. Fetch list of group tournaments and store it
2. Build and display flutter page based on the groups list (if you can’t find the source for any visual
element – eg. text, image - use mock data)
3. Update list of group tournaments based on websocket update events (implement reactive state
based on Providers package)
